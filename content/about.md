Feel free to browse the [posts section](/posts) to see all that I have posted about, currently ranging from setting up Wazuh to installing everyone's favourite Linux distribution.

I‚Äôm a system administrator working on transitioning into information security. I have been enthusiastic about tech for as long as I can remember, already jailbreaking my first iPhone (and likely one of the first ones in Finland at the time) in 2007 soon after it released, and kept on that track for many years to come. My career itself in IT would begin in late 2018, when my love towards technology exceeded my passion for crawling in the woods during my conscription, and I ended up working as an ICT professional during my service. From there on I would go onto working in one of the most important tech stores in the country, an important player in the BIM software industry and also gained valuable years of experience from the consultancy world. 

My career has been on an uptrend in terms of development, starting all the way from regular IT support related duties and now having several years of experience from system administration, ranging from hypervisor administration experience to hunting for vulnerabilities in a company's network, planning and executing SOC work and much more. 

Right now I am looking for roles in red teaming, offensive security, incident response or cloud security. I am currently studying the Bug Bounty Hunter path in HackTheBox, and planning on studying for one of the Azure certifications mentioned below.

üìù **Certifications**

- Microsoft Certified: Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals (MS-900)
- SC-300, SC-200, AZ-104 planned (Courses done for all three certifications)
