Wazuh is a really cool free, open source tool that unifies XDR and SIEM capabilities into one neat package. It has features such as vulnerability detection, file integrity monitoring and log data analysis, and a lot more. I have previously used Wazuh in a professional capacity, and have been meaning to install it into my own environment, which is what this post is about.

**Objective**

- Vulnerability management for clients, starting with PCs in the network, and later on adding in servers
  - Automatic scanning network-wide in faster intervals than what the default is

- Making dashboards for monitoring vulnerabilities, perhaps setting up an automatic messaging system for when vulnerabilities are found (Telegram/Discord bot)
- File integrity monitoring for PCs
- Making use of log collecting and perhaps exporting them to another platform to visualize said logs
- Look into the IPS/IDS capabilities of the tool and see what could be implemented
- Any other cool thing I come across

**Getting started**

Wazuh has some really good documentation on their website which is what I'll be using to guide me through the installation of this tool (https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/index.html). There's a few ways to install Wazuh:

- Ready-to-use machines in the form of OVAs; pre-built VM images that can be imported to any OVA compatible virtualization systems
- Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which can be launched directly on an AWS cloud instance
- Containers (Docker or Kubernetes)
- Offline
- From source 

Since I have my own homelab, I'll be installing Wazuh there. 

Wazuh comprises of three central platform components that'll be running on the installed server(s) and then the **individual agents** that will be installed to each client that I want to be talking with Wazuh:

- **Wazuh indexer** (this component is in charge of indexing and storing alerts that are generated by Wazuh server)
- **Wazuh server** (this one's job is to analyze the data received from agents, following certain rules and looking for indicators of compromise, IOCs.)
- **Wazuh dashboard** (this is the GUI element of the tool that can be accessed through the browser. It comes pre-installed with certain dashboards and can be customised a lot.)

It's also possible, I just learned, to also monitor agent-less devices as well via Syslog, so things such as firewalls or switches, or even an IDS. More information on all of this can be found at https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/getting-started/components/index.html.
