      <description>A while ago I built a NAS, discovered I want faster than gigabit speeds so I then bought myself a switch which has 1 GbE, 2.5 GbE and even 10 GbE SFP+ ports. Many devices in my home network already support 2.5 GbE speeds, so it was about time I be able to actually utilize that speed as well.
However, when switching from an old HP switch with VLAN capabilities to a Unifi one, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very straightforward to have all my VLANS from ESXi accessible on the switch, nor to even setup the switch itself.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been many changes in my internal network in the past few months. For several years I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to build a NAS in order to start self-hosting more and more things and rely less on the &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo;, and finally did so. I bought a setup as follows:
Case: Fractal Design Define 7 (lots of space for HDDs) Motherboard: Asrock Z790 Pro RS/D4 (mostly because of the crazy amount of 8 sata ports, making it so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to buy any SATA expansion cards yet.</description>
