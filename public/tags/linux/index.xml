      <title>Upgrading Wazuh components</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought upgrading Wazuh along with its several components would be as simple as running &lt;code&gt;sudo apt update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo apt upgrade -y&lt;/code&gt;, but last time when I attempted this a few months ago, the setup stopped working, so I&amp;rsquo;m documenting the steps required to update the setup in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/upgrade-guide/upgrading-central-components.html&#34;&gt;proper manner&lt;/a&gt; to the tunes of Virtual Riot, one of the most talented EDM artists out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I obviously will run &lt;code&gt;apt update&lt;/code&gt;  on both the Wazuh Indexer and Wazuh Server servers, as I chose to install the components in Ubuntu. I then apparently need to install the &lt;code&gt;gnupg apt-transport-https&lt;/code&gt; before continuing, and install the Wazuh GPG key with:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Installing GUI in Arch Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I installed Arch Linux, but have since been pre-occupied with other tasks and a vacation to the Canary Islands (highly recommend Tenerife with a rented car!) so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a chance to post this until now. As promised, I will now be installing the GUI portion of the OS, and what I like to use for that specifically is called Hyprland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nvidia-required-steps&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia required steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a problem is that my discrete GPU is an NVIDIA one, and Hyprland isn&amp;rsquo;t even officially supported on NVIDIA cards. I might end up getting a cheap AMD card later on and use the AMD one for Linux and NVIDIA one for a Windows VM (for certain games) if this proves to be a nuisance down the road, but I have previously been able to use Hyprland just fine with my existing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Returning to Arch Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a sort of rite of passage for many IT professionals out there dabbling with Linux, I think many at some point end up installing Arch Linux, including myself. I have previously used Arch Linux multiple times, and the last time that I ended up going back to Windows was because of getting a new HDR enabled monitor which is something that isn&amp;rsquo;t really supported on Linux, and that was the excuse to never boot back to Arch. However, especially after hearing about Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Recall feature, I decided that now is the time to return. Thus I am making this post explaining how I install Arch Linux. I will have a dualboot setup, so I can hopefully spend most of my time in Linux, and only use Windows when absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
