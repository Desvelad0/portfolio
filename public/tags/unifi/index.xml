      <title>Network upgrade part 2: Unifi switch in non Unifi environment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I built a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.nmrs.fi/posts/network_upgrade/&#34;&gt;NAS&lt;/a&gt;, discovered I want faster than gigabit speeds so I then bought myself a switch which has 1 GbE, 2.5 GbE and even 10 GbE SFP+ ports. Many devices in my home network already support 2.5 GbE speeds, so it was about time I be able to actually utilize that speed as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, when switching from an old HP switch with VLAN capabilities to a Unifi one, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very straightforward to have all my VLANS from ESXi accessible on the switch, nor to even setup the switch itself. Compared to the HP one where one could simply plug it in and log into the switch and begin configuring it, in the Unifi world things aren&amp;rsquo;t as simple: to even begin configuring the thing, you have to either have a Unifi controller enabled device such as a Unifi Dream Machine or Dream Machine Pro and if you don&amp;rsquo;t, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to install the controller software elsewhere. You can&amp;rsquo;t simply log into the switch and start configuring it; the only thing you can do is to SSH to it in order to connect it to a controller. Bit weird if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Network upgrade part 1: TrueNAS SCALE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been many changes in my internal network in the past few months. For several years I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to build a NAS in order to start self-hosting more and more things and rely less on the &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo;, and finally did so. I bought a setup as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case:&lt;/strong&gt; Fractal Design Define 7 (lots of space for HDDs)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motherboard:&lt;/strong&gt; Asrock Z790 Pro RS/D4 (mostly because of the crazy amount of 8 sata ports, making it so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to buy any SATA expansion cards yet.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CPU:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel Core i5-13400F (This one I chose mostly due to it having a nice amount of cores/threads for virtualization, 6 performance cores and 4 efficiency-cores)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAM:&lt;/strong&gt; Kingston FURY Beast DDR4 3200 MHz CL16 32 Gt (I thought 32 GB would be more than enough but turns out that if you want to run any VMs, more is probably good as ZFS enjoys RAM)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PSU:&lt;/strong&gt; Asus Rog Strix 750W Gold Aura Edition 80+ Gold (This is really good due to it being really quiet and power efficient according to Cybenetics test; it&amp;rsquo;s also made by Seasonic which has been a very reputable PSU manufacturer for quite a while)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDD:&lt;/strong&gt; 6 x 16 TB X18 Exos drives (might as well have enough space to have a big enough buffer for the foreseeable future)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I installed the latest stable version of TrueNAS SCALE and the installation was very simple; you just have to decide what drive to install the OS to, choose a root password and choose whether or not you want to have a swap partition. I chose to go with SCALE due to it being the newer version of TrueNAS which is built on Linux, whereas the older version, CORE is based on BSD. There&amp;rsquo;s several features such as virtualization which can only be achieved on SCALE, so that, it being updated more frequently and me being more comfortable on Linux, I chose SCALE. Both utilize the OpenZFS file system which will protect my data with features such as self-healing features, incremental snapshots, software-defined raid and even replication to off-site targets. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
