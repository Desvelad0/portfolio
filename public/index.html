    <p>I thought upgrading Wazuh along with its several components would be as simple as running ``sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y`, but last time when I attempted this a few months ago, the setup stopped working, so I‚Äôm documenting the steps required to update the setup in a proper manner to the tunes of Virtual Riot, one of the most talented EDM artists out there.
First I obviously will run apt update on both the Wazuh Indexer and Wazuh Server servers, as I chose to install the components in Ubuntu. I then apparently need to install the gnupg apt-transport-https before continuing, and install the Wazuh GPG key with:

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This past weekend I went to Disobey, which if you are reading this and have not gone, I implore you to do so next year, it was a great experience for anyone interested in cyber security and any aspiring sticker collector.
At the event, I spoke with several people regarding employment in the field, and many mentioned how important it is to be comfortable using Microsoft Sentinel, as it is often used as the collection point for any logs an environment produces and configured to generate alerts depending on the needs of a company. I have previously used Sentinel to monitor and act on security alerts, but thought it would be a good exercise to set up the tool from scratch in my own environment, and while doing so, learn more about how to use Terraform for better cloud automation.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Network upgrade part 2: Unifi switch in non Unifi environment
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A while ago I built a NAS, discovered I want faster than gigabit speeds so I then bought myself a switch which has 1 GbE, 2.5 GbE and even 10 GbE SFP&#43; ports. Many devices in my home network already support 2.5 GbE speeds, so it was about time I be able to actually utilize that speed as well.
However, when switching from an old HP switch with VLAN capabilities to a Unifi one, it wasn‚Äôt very straightforward to have all my VLANS from ESXi accessible on the switch, nor to even setup the switch itself. Compared to the HP one where one could simply plug it in and log into the switch and begin configuring it, in the Unifi world things aren‚Äôt as simple: to even begin configuring the thing, you have to either have a Unifi controller enabled device such as a Unifi Dream Machine or Dream Machine Pro and if you don‚Äôt, you‚Äôll have to install the controller software elsewhere. You can‚Äôt simply log into the switch and start configuring it; the only thing you can do is to SSH to it in order to connect it to a controller. Bit weird if you ask me.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>There‚Äôs been many changes in my internal network in the past few months. For several years I‚Äôve wanted to build a NAS in order to start self-hosting more and more things and rely less on the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù, and finally did so. I bought a setup as follows:
Case: Fractal Design Define 7 (lots of space for HDDs) Motherboard: Asrock Z790 Pro RS/D4 (mostly because of the crazy amount of 8 sata ports, making it so I don‚Äôt have to buy any SATA expansion cards yet.) CPU: Intel Core i5-13400F (This one I chose mostly due to it having a nice amount of cores/threads for virtualization, 6 performance cores and 4 efficiency-cores) RAM: Kingston FURY Beast DDR4 3200 MHz CL16 32 Gt (I thought 32 GB would be more than enough but turns out that if you want to run any VMs, more is probably good as ZFS enjoys RAM) PSU: Asus Rog Strix 750W Gold Aura Edition 80&#43; Gold (This is really good due to it being really quiet and power efficient according to Cybenetics test; it‚Äôs also made by Seasonic which has been a very reputable PSU manufacturer for quite a while) HDD: 6 x 16 TB X18 Exos drives (might as well have enough space to have a big enough buffer for the foreseeable future) I installed the latest stable version of TrueNAS SCALE and the installation was very simple; you just have to decide what drive to install the OS to, choose a root password and choose whether or not you want to have a swap partition. I chose to go with SCALE due to it being the newer version of TrueNAS which is built on Linux, whereas the older version, CORE is based on BSD. There‚Äôs several features such as virtualization which can only be achieved on SCALE, so that, it being updated more frequently and me being more comfortable on Linux, I chose SCALE. Both utilize the OpenZFS file system which will protect my data with features such as self-healing features, incremental snapshots, software-defined raid and even replication to off-site targets. Awesome.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>A while ago I installed Arch Linux, but have since been pre-occupied with other tasks and a vacation to the Canary Islands (highly recommend Tenerife with a rented car!) so I didn‚Äôt have a chance to post this until now. As promised, I will now be installing the GUI portion of the OS, and what I like to use for that specifically is called Hyprland.
Nvidia required steps Now, a problem is that my discrete GPU is an NVIDIA one, and Hyprland isn‚Äôt even officially supported on NVIDIA cards. I might end up getting a cheap AMD card later on and use the AMD one for Linux and NVIDIA one for a Windows VM (for certain games) if this proves to be a nuisance down the road, but I have previously been able to use Hyprland just fine with my existing hardware.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>As a sort of rite of passage for many IT professionals out there dabbling with Linux, I think many at some point end up installing Arch Linux, including myself. I have previously used Arch Linux multiple times, and the last time that I ended up going back to Windows was because of getting a new HDR enabled monitor which is something that isn‚Äôt really supported on Linux, and that was the excuse to never boot back to Arch. However, especially after hearing about Microsoft‚Äôs Recall feature, I decided that now is the time to return. Thus I am making this post explaining how I install Arch Linux. I will have a dualboot setup, so I can hopefully spend most of my time in Linux, and only use Windows when absolutely necessary.

Drilling into vulnerabilities of an agent I have slowly been rolling out Wazuh to my servers, starting with an important Ubuntu Server, which is my only Linux server that has a GUI for website access locally on the machine. As it is a still essentially a server, despite it having a desktop installation, there are many things that come pre-installed that I don‚Äôt personally need, such as bluetooth drivers.
