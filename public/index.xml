      <description>Feel free to browse the posts section to see all that I have posted about, currently ranging from setting up Wazuh to installing everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite Linux distribution.
You can contact me at hello@nmrs.fi!
Iâ€™m a system administrator working on transitioning into information security. I have been enthusiastic about tech for as long as I can remember, already jailbreaking my first iPhone (and likely one of the first ones in Finland at the time) in 2007 soon after it released, and kept on that track for many years to come.</description>

      <description>As a sort of rite of passage for many IT professionals out there dabbling with Linux, I think many at some point end up installing Arch Linux, including myself. I have previously used Arch Linux multiple times, and the last time that I ended up going back to Windows was because of getting a new HDR enabled monitor which is something that isn&amp;rsquo;t really supported on Linux, and that was the excuse to never boot back to Arch.</description>

      <title>Finding and fixing vulnerabilities with Wazuh</title>

      <description>Since the last post got a bit long, I thought I would make this one just to show how Wazuh works in practise, hopefully in a more digestible manner.
Drilling into vulnerabilities of an agent I have slowly been rolling out Wazuh to my servers, starting with an important Ubuntu Server, which is my only Linux server that has a GUI for website access locally on the machine. As it is a still essentially a server, despite it having a desktop installation, there are many things that come pre-installed that I don&amp;rsquo;t personally need, such as bluetooth drivers.</description>

      <description>Wazuh is a really cool free, open source tool that unifies XDR and SIEM capabilities into one neat package. It has features such as vulnerability detection, file integrity monitoring and log data analysis, threat hunting, posture management and a bunch more. I have previously used Wazuh in a professional capacity, and have been meaning to install it into my own environment, which is what this post is about. I will be following the version 4.</description>
