      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I went to Disobey, which if you are reading this and have not gone, I implore you to do so next year, it was a great experience for anyone interested in cyber security and any aspiring sticker collector.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the event, I spoke with several people regarding employment in the field, and many mentioned how important it is to be comfortable using Microsoft Sentinel, as it is often used as the collection point for any logs an environment produces and configured to generate alerts depending on the needs of a company.  I have previously used Sentinel to monitor and act on security alerts, but thought it would be a good exercise to set up the tool from scratch in my own environment, and while doing so, learn more about how to use Terraform for better cloud automation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Network upgrade part 2: Unifi switch in non Unifi environment</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/network_upgrade_pt2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I built a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.nmrs.fi/posts/network_upgrade/&#34;&gt;NAS&lt;/a&gt;, discovered I want faster than gigabit speeds so I then bought myself a switch which has 1 GbE, 2.5 GbE and even 10 GbE SFP+ ports. Many devices in my home network already support 2.5 GbE speeds, so it was about time I be able to actually utilize that speed as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, when switching from an old HP switch with VLAN capabilities to a Unifi one, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very straightforward to have all my VLANS from ESXi accessible on the switch, nor to even setup the switch itself. Compared to the HP one where one could simply plug it in and log into the switch and begin configuring it, in the Unifi world things aren&amp;rsquo;t as simple: to even begin configuring the thing, you have to either have a Unifi controller enabled device such as a Unifi Dream Machine or Dream Machine Pro and if you don&amp;rsquo;t, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to install the controller software elsewhere. You can&amp;rsquo;t simply log into the switch and start configuring it; the only thing you can do is to SSH to it in order to connect it to a controller. Bit weird if you ask me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Network upgrade part 1: TrueNAS SCALE</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s been many changes in my internal network in the past few months. For several years I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to build a NAS in order to start self-hosting more and more things and rely less on the &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo;, and finally did so. I bought a setup as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case:&lt;/strong&gt; Fractal Design Define 7 (lots of space for HDDs)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motherboard:&lt;/strong&gt; Asrock Z790 Pro RS/D4 (mostly because of the crazy amount of 8 sata ports, making it so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to buy any SATA expansion cards yet.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CPU:&lt;/strong&gt; Intel Core i5-13400F (This one I chose mostly due to it having a nice amount of cores/threads for virtualization, 6 performance cores and 4 efficiency-cores)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAM:&lt;/strong&gt; Kingston FURY Beast DDR4 3200 MHz CL16 32 Gt (I thought 32 GB would be more than enough but turns out that if you want to run any VMs, more is probably good as ZFS enjoys RAM)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PSU:&lt;/strong&gt; Asus Rog Strix 750W Gold Aura Edition 80+ Gold (This is really good due to it being really quiet and power efficient according to Cybenetics test; it&amp;rsquo;s also made by Seasonic which has been a very reputable PSU manufacturer for quite a while)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDD:&lt;/strong&gt; 6 x 16 TB X18 Exos drives (might as well have enough space to have a big enough buffer for the foreseeable future)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I installed the latest stable version of TrueNAS SCALE and the installation was very simple; you just have to decide what drive to install the OS to, choose a root password and choose whether or not you want to have a swap partition. I chose to go with SCALE due to it being the newer version of TrueNAS which is built on Linux, whereas the older version, CORE is based on BSD. There&amp;rsquo;s several features such as virtualization which can only be achieved on SCALE, so that, it being updated more frequently and me being more comfortable on Linux, I chose SCALE. Both utilize the OpenZFS file system which will protect my data with features such as self-healing features, incremental snapshots, software-defined raid and even replication to off-site targets. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Installing GUI in Arch Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I installed Arch Linux, but have since been pre-occupied with other tasks and a vacation to the Canary Islands (highly recommend Tenerife with a rented car!) so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a chance to post this until now. As promised, I will now be installing the GUI portion of the OS, and what I like to use for that specifically is called Hyprland.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;nvidia-required-steps&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nvidia required steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, a problem is that my discrete GPU is an NVIDIA one, and Hyprland isn&amp;rsquo;t even officially supported on NVIDIA cards. I might end up getting a cheap AMD card later on and use the AMD one for Linux and NVIDIA one for a Windows VM (for certain games) if this proves to be a nuisance down the road, but I have previously been able to use Hyprland just fine with my existing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Feel free to browse the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts&#34;&gt;posts section&lt;/a&gt; to see all that I have posted about, currently ranging from setting up Wazuh to installing everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite Linux distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can contact me at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hello@nmrs.fi&#34;&gt;hello@nmrs.fi&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m very much looking for employment and  would love to chat more and connect on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Iâ€™m a system administrator working on transitioning into information security. I have been enthusiastic about tech for as long as I can remember, already jailbreaking my first iPhone (and likely one of the first ones in Finland at the time) in 2007 soon after it released, and kept on that track for many years to come. My career itself in IT would begin in the late 2010s, when my love towards technology exceeded my passion for crawling in the woods during my conscription, and I ended up working as an ICT professional during my service. From there on I would go onto working in one of the most important tech stores in the country, an important player in the BIM software industry and also gained valuable years of experience from the consultancy world as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Returning to Arch Linux</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/returning_to_arch_linux/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a sort of rite of passage for many IT professionals out there dabbling with Linux, I think many at some point end up installing Arch Linux, including myself. I have previously used Arch Linux multiple times, and the last time that I ended up going back to Windows was because of getting a new HDR enabled monitor which is something that isn&amp;rsquo;t really supported on Linux, and that was the excuse to never boot back to Arch. However, especially after hearing about Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Recall feature, I decided that now is the time to return. Thus I am making this post explaining how I install Arch Linux. I will have a dualboot setup, so I can hopefully spend most of my time in Linux, and only use Windows when absolutely necessary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Finding and fixing vulnerabilities with Wazuh</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the last post got a bit long, I thought I would make this one just to show how Wazuh works in practise, hopefully in a more digestible manner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;drilling-into-vulnerabilities-of-an-agent&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drilling into vulnerabilities of an agent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have slowly been rolling out Wazuh to my servers, starting with an important Ubuntu Server, which is my only Linux server that has a GUI for website access locally on the machine. As it is a still essentially a server, despite it having a desktop installation, there are many things that come pre-installed that I don&amp;rsquo;t personally need, such as bluetooth drivers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wazuh is a really cool free, open source tool that unifies XDR and SIEM capabilities into one neat package. It has features such as vulnerability detection, file integrity monitoring and log data analysis, threat hunting, posture management and a bunch more. I have previously used Wazuh in a professional capacity, and have been meaning to install it into my own environment, which is what this post is about. I will be following the version 4.7 documentation for the service. At the end of the post you can see a rough diagram of the finished setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
