      <description>About me
⚒️ Posts Feel free to browse the posts section to see all that I have posted about, currently ranging from setting up Wazuh to installing everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite Linux distribution.
You can contact me at hello@nmrs.fi!
I’m a system administrator working on transitioning into information security. I have been enthusiastic about tech for as long as I can remember, already jailbreaking my first iPhone (and likely one of the first ones in Finland at the time) in 2007 soon after it released, and kept on that track for many years to come.</description>
