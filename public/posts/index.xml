      <description>This past weekend I went to Disobey, which if you are reading this and have not gone, I implore you to do so next year, it was a great experience for anyone interested in cyber security and any aspiring sticker collector.
At the event, I spoke with several people regarding employment in the field, and many mentioned how important it is to be comfortable using Microsoft Sentinel, as it is often used as the collection point for any logs an environment produces and configured to generate alerts depending on the needs of a company.</description>

      <title>Network upgrade part 2: Unifi switch in non Unifi environment</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/network_upgrade_pt2/</link>

      <description>A while ago I built a NAS, discovered I want faster than gigabit speeds so I then bought myself a switch which has 1 GbE, 2.5 GbE and even 10 GbE SFP+ ports. Many devices in my home network already support 2.5 GbE speeds, so it was about time I be able to actually utilize that speed as well.
However, when switching from an old HP switch with VLAN capabilities to a Unifi one, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very straightforward to have all my VLANS from ESXi accessible on the switch, nor to even setup the switch itself.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s been many changes in my internal network in the past few months. For several years I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to build a NAS in order to start self-hosting more and more things and rely less on the &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo;, and finally did so. I bought a setup as follows:
Case: Fractal Design Define 7 (lots of space for HDDs) Motherboard: Asrock Z790 Pro RS/D4 (mostly because of the crazy amount of 8 sata ports, making it so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to buy any SATA expansion cards yet.</description>

      <title>Installing GUI on Arch Linux</title>

      <description>A while ago I installed Arch Linux, but have since been pre-occupied with other tasks and a vacation to the Canary Islands (highly recommend Tenerife with a rented car!) so I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a chance to post this until now. As promised, I will now be installing the GUI portion of the OS, and what I like to use for that specifically is called Hyprland.
Nvidia required steps Now, a problem is that my discrete GPU is an NVIDIA one, and Hyprland isn&amp;rsquo;t even officially supported on NVIDIA cards.</description>

      <title>Returning to Arch Linux</title>

      <description>As a sort of rite of passage for many IT professionals out there dabbling with Linux, I think many at some point end up installing Arch Linux, including myself. I have previously used Arch Linux multiple times, and the last time that I ended up going back to Windows was because of getting a new HDR enabled monitor which is something that isn&amp;rsquo;t really supported on Linux, and that was the excuse to never boot back to Arch.</description>

      <title>Finding and fixing vulnerabilities with Wazuh</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/wazuh_inuse/</link>

      <description>Since the last post got a bit long, I thought I would make this one just to show how Wazuh works in practise, hopefully in a more digestible manner.
Drilling into vulnerabilities of an agent I have slowly been rolling out Wazuh to my servers, starting with an important Ubuntu Server, which is my only Linux server that has a GUI for website access locally on the machine. As it is a still essentially a server, despite it having a desktop installation, there are many things that come pre-installed that I don&amp;rsquo;t personally need, such as bluetooth drivers.</description>

      <title>Installing and configuring Wazuh</title>

      <description>Wazuh is a really cool free, open source tool that unifies XDR and SIEM capabilities into one neat package. It has features such as vulnerability detection, file integrity monitoring and log data analysis, threat hunting, posture management and a bunch more. I have previously used Wazuh in a professional capacity, and have been meaning to install it into my own environment, which is what this post is about. I will be following the version 4.</description>
